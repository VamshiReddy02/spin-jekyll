# A simple Jekyll statically generated application, running on Spin

This is a template for building and statically exporting your
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) application and running it on
[`Fermyon Spin`](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin).

## Using the template

To get started, open the [spin-jekyll](https://github.com/VamshiReddy02/spin-jekyll) repository and click the "Use this template" button. Before you can build your Jekyll application, make sure to install ` jekyll and bundler gems`. You are now ready to start building your front-end. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and start editing your application. Alternatively, you can run `spin build` and `spin up` to build and run your application.


## Deploy your application to Fermyon Cloud

Using a free [Fermyon Cloud](https://cloud.fermyon.com) account, you can deploy
your WebAssembly applications and get a public URL:

```console
$ spin deploy
# your application will now be available at a *.fermyon.app URL
```
